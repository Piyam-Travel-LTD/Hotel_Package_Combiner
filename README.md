A simple, client-side web application to help travel staff quickly mix-and-match hotel options for Makkah and Madinah and generate sorted pricing.

## Features

-   Dynamically add or remove any number of hotels for each city.
-   Enter guest occupancy (Adults, Children) to define the number of "paying guests".
-   Input the **total room price** for each hotel.
-   Generates all possible Makkah + Madinah combinations.
